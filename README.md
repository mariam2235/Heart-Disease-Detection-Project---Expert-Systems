# ❤️Heart Disease Detection System❤️

## 📋 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Heart Disease Detection System that combines a rule-based expert system and a machine learning model (Decision Tree Classifier). It provides both medical reasoning and predictive analytics based on patient input, with a user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit.

## ✅ Key Features
- **Rule-Based Expert System** powered by the Experta library.
- **Decision Tree Classifier** trained with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Streamlit web application** for easy and interactive user input.
- Dynamic **confidence-based predictions** blending expert and model assessments.
- Risk factor visualizations (bar chart and pie chart) based on personal data.
- Downloadable patient report in CSV format.
- Extensive input parameters: cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, glucose, exercise, smoking, alcohol, stress, sleep hours, family history, chest pain, and more.

## 🌐 Streamlit Application Details
- The app provides a sidebar with comprehensive health input fields (age, cholesterol, BP, glucose, BMI, etc.).
- After input submission, it shows expert system outputs and model-based predictions with confidence levels.
- Interactive visualizations:
  - Bar charts for key health metrics.
  - Pie charts showing factor contributions to overall risk.
- Downloadable reports for users in CSV format.
- Responsive UI with wide layout support for a smooth experience.
- Ready to be deployed on Streamlit Cloud or Heroku for remote access.

## 📊 Dataset Details
The dataset includes features such as:
- Age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, glucose, BMI
- Exercise frequency, smoking status, alcohol consumption
- Diet type, family history, chest pain type, rest ECG results, and more.
- Source: [Add dataset source or citation if applicable]

## 🧠 Expert System Rules Summary
- High cholesterol combined with age triggers warning.
- Blood pressure issues and smoking raise alerts.
- Poor diet and obesity contribute to risks.
- Genetic factors combined with unhealthy lifestyle conditions are highlighted.
- Inactivity and stress levels are factored into risk.
- Real-time explanations of triggered rules are shown to the user.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
- Decision Tree Classifier trained with GridSearchCV.
- Key metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
- Stored using `joblib` for fast inference.
- Combined prediction confidence calculated using probability and custom risk score.

## 📈 Key Visualizations in the App
- Bar plot: Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, BMI, Glucose, Sleep Hours.
- Pie chart: Relative contribution of cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, glucose, and sleep & stress factors.
- Downloadable CSV report of user inputs and prediction.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Deployment on cloud (Heroku/Streamlit Cloud).
- Additional ensemble models.
- Historical tracking of user predictions.
- More detailed educational content and tips.
- Mobile responsiveness and theme customization in Streamlit.
